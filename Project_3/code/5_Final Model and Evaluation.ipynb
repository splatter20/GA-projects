       "'Regret losing my virginity 4 years ago So when I was 19 I was used and abused by a sociopath who peer pressured and Coerced me into sex. During those times I was always insecure and he used that to his advantage. \\n\\nMy point is I still regret it because in my culture/religion clearly premarital sex isnâ€™t allowed, and yet I had sacrificed it for the sake of wanting this persons love and affection only in return to be stuck in a cycle of being groomed, used, disrespected and then discarded, repeat. \\n\\nAs a women I feel like I no longer hold value and worry that no man will love me or marry me, like Iâ€™m some damaged goods. \\n\\nWhat I also worry about now is what if I contracted hpv from this person? He slept with 9 other women before me, and I donâ€™t know where they had been in which makes me feel dirty. And I canâ€™t get checked till Iâ€™m 25. Although to my understanding you can clear hpv and hpv vaccine protects you from high risk strains but Iâ€™m still paranoid by the thought of cervical cancer (god forbid)\\n\\n(Sorry for going off topic for a moment. )\\n\\nI just donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this and the thoughts have been weighing on my mind all day, thereâ€™s so many what ifs when it comes to love, relationships, marriage and sex and whatever Iâ€™m good enough for a good man despite losing my virginity.'"
